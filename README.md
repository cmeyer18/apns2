# APNS/2 
test
## Example

```go
package main

import (
  "log"
  "fmt"

  "github.com/cmeyer18/apns2"
  "github.com/cmeyer18/apns2/certificate"
)

func main() {

  cert, err := certificate.FromP12File("../cert.p12", "")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Cert Error:", err)
  }

  notification := &apns2.Notification{}
  notification.DeviceToken = "11aa01229f15f0f0c52029d8cf8cd0aeaf2365fe4cebc4af26cd6d76b7919ef7"
  notification.Topic = "com.sideshow.Apns2"
  notification.Payload = []byte(`{"aps":{"alert":"Hello!"}}`) // See Payload section below

  // If you want to test push notifications for builds running directly from XCode (Development), use
  // client := apns2.NewClient(cert).Development()
  // For apps published to the app store or installed as an ad-hoc distribution use Production()

  client := apns2.NewClient(cert).Production()
  res, err := client.Push(notification)

  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Error:", err)
  }

  fmt.Printf("%v %v %v\n", res.StatusCode, res.ApnsID, res.Reason)
}
```

## JWT Token Example

Instead of using a `.p12` or `.pem` certificate as above, you can optionally use
APNs JWT _Provider Authentication Tokens_. First you will need a signing key (`.p8` file), Key ID and Team ID [from Apple](http://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev54d690a66). Once you have these details, you can create a new client:

```go
authKey, err := token.AuthKeyFromFile("../AuthKey_XXX.p8")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal("token error:", err)
}

token := &token.Token{
  AuthKey: authKey,
  // KeyID from developer account (Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles -> Keys)
  KeyID:   "ABC123DEFG",
  // TeamID from developer account (View Account -> Membership)
  TeamID:  "DEF123GHIJ",
}
...

client := apns2.NewTokenClient(token)
res, err := client.Push(notification)
```

- You can use one APNs signing key to authenticate tokens for multiple apps.
- A signing key works for both the development and production environments.
- A signing key doesnâ€™t expire but can be revoked.

## Notification

At a minimum, a _Notification_ needs a _DeviceToken_, a _Topic_ and a _Payload_.

```go
notification := &apns2.Notification{
  DeviceToken: "11aa01229f15f0f0c52029d8cf8cd0aeaf2365fe4cebc4af26cd6d76b7919ef7",
  Topic: "com.sideshow.Apns2",
  Payload: []byte(`{"aps":{"alert":"Hello!"}}`),
}
```

You can also set an optional _ApnsID_, _Expiration_ or _Priority_.

```go
notification.ApnsID =  "40636A2C-C093-493E-936A-2A4333C06DEA"
notification.Expiration = time.Now()
notification.Priority = apns2.PriorityLow
```

## Payload

You can use raw bytes for the `notification.Payload` as above, or you can use the payload builder package which makes it easy to construct APNs payloads.

```go
// {"aps":{"alert":"hello","badge":1},"key":"val"}

payload := payload.NewPayload().Alert("hello").Badge(1).Custom("key", "val")

notification.Payload = payload
client.Push(notification)
```

Refer to the [payload](https://godoc.org/github.com/sideshow/apns2/payload) docs for more info.

## Response, Error handling

APNS/2 draws the distinction between a valid response from Apple indicating whether or not the _Notification_ was sent or not, and an unrecoverable or unexpected _Error_;

- An `Error` is returned if a non-recoverable error occurs, i.e. if there is a problem with the underlying _http.Client_ connection or _Certificate_, the payload was not sent, or a valid _Response_ was not received.
- A `Response` is returned if the payload was successfully sent to Apple and a documented response was received. This struct will contain more information about whether or not the push notification succeeded, its _apns-id_ and if applicable, more information around why it did not succeed.

To check if a `Notification` was successfully sent;

```go
res, err := client.Push(notification)
if err != nil {
  log.Println("There was an error", err)
  return
}

if res.Sent() {
  log.Println("Sent:", res.ApnsID)
} else {
  fmt.Printf("Not Sent: %v %v %v\n", res.StatusCode, res.ApnsID, res.Reason)
}
```

## Context & Timeouts

For better control over request cancellations and timeouts APNS/2 supports
contexts. Using a context can be helpful if you want to cancel all pushes when
the parent process is cancelled, or need finer grained control over individual
push timeouts. See the [Google post](https://blog.golang.org/context) for more
information on contexts.

```go
ctx, cancel = context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10 * time.Second)
res, err := client.PushWithContext(ctx, notification)
defer cancel()
```
